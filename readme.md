# Object-to-object mapping framework microbenchmark #

Multi-layered applications often require to map between different object models (e.g. DTOs and entities). 
Writing such boiler plate mapping code is a tedious and error-prone task.
A lot of object-to-object mapping Java frameworks aims to simplify this work and automate it.
Some uses code instrospection (eg. Dozer). Other uses code generation (ex: MapStuct).
This micro-benchmark compares performance of 5 frameworks. Results could be compared to the benchmark of a code written manually. 

Benchmark are powered by a tool called [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) or also known as "Java Microbenchmarking Harness".
JMH is developed by the OpenJDK team. 

## Benchmarked object to object mapper frameworks ## 

- [Dozer](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer)
- [MapStruct](http://mapstruct.org/)
- [ModelMapper](http://modelmapper.org/)
- [Selma](http://www.selma-java.org/)

## Contributing to benchmark ##


Github is for social coding platform: if you want to add another mapping framework or optimize an existing one, we encourage contributions through pull requests from [forks of this repository](http://help.github.com/forking/). If you want to contribute code this way, please reference a GitHub ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.


## Data model ##

The data model used by this benchmark is very basic. It comes from the [Comparison](https://github.com/jhalterman/modelmapper/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/modelmapper/performance/Comparison.java) class from the ModelMapper framework.
It includes combinations which usually appear in Java Beans, such as:

* Object types
* Collections


## Launch the benchmark ##

_Pre-requisites: Maven 3.x and a JDK 6 (or above)_
